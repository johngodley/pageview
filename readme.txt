Allows the insertion of code to display an external webpage within an iframe, along with a title and description.

== Description ==

PageView is a plugin that will display another web page inside the current post. This is achieved with the use of an iframe - an HTML tag that allows a webpage to be displayed inline with the current page. Although an iframe can lead to a complicated website, it can be very effective when used appropriately.

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:


1. Download `pageview.zip`
1. Unzip
1. Upload `pageview` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin

You can find full details of installing a plugin on the [plugin installation page](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/how-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin/).

== Documentation ==

Full documentation can be found on the [Pageview](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/pageview/) page.
